/**
 * Convert a full nested aggregations object into a simpler subset that
 * can be more easily queried for specific results, by removing intermediate
 * keys.
 *
 * The resulting format is
 *
 * [Grouping Q Answer ID][ID of non-grouping MC Q][Answer ID from that MC Q]: count
 *
 * Original JSON:
 *
 *     "aggregations": {
 *       "9f27d5a6ed65c4938ede65e536e5f6d4": {
 *         "mc": {
 *           "c873a345-185c-cdb1-aeeb-32b04cf4fc9a": {
 *             "question": "Which issue should be highest on the new presidentâ€™s agenda?",
 *             "answers": {
 *               "b1cc14fffa31a73de64ba82e99ecfbe6": {
 *                 "answer": "Social Issues",
 *                 "count": 2
 *
 * Revised JSON:
 *
 *     "aggregations": {
 *       [groupKey]
 *       "9f27d5a6ed65c4938ede65e536e5f6d4": {

 * @param {Object} aggregations The aggregations property of the root JSON file
