#Using Ask for Tell Our Next President


##This section includes how to manage submissions, how to embed the form separate from the interactive, how to change the questions.


##Managing submissions


When you log in, you'll see a list of existing forms. There should only be one form, called Election Reaction Survey. Click on the title to open the submission manager.

This is the submission manager, where responses to the form will appear.

The latest submissions are at the top of the queue. **A submission is not included in the infographic until you bookmark it.** You can do that by:


* clicking on the small bookmark icon in the submissions list
* clicking on the Bookmark button in the top right
* pressing "b" on your keyboard with the submission highlighted


If you don't want to include a submission, but mark it as reviewed, flag it. You can do that by:


* clicking on the small flag icon in the submissions list
* clicking on the Flag button in the top right
* pressing "f" on your keyboard with the submission highlighted


You can use the mouse or "J" and "K" on the keyboard to navigate through the submission list.


At the top of the submission list are various options:


* You can search for a particular word in a submission
* You can filter out flagged submissions or only show bookmarked submissions
* You can download all the responses as a CSV list
* You can change the order from most recent first to oldest first


There are also many options in Ask that don't apply to this infographic. The Ask Gallery - a way to edit and display the best submissions in a simple embeddable format - is the main feature that isn't being used here. You can ignore the buttons "Send to Gallery" and the "Gallery" tab at the top of the page.


##How to change the questions


You can change the wording on the questions by clicking on Edit Form at the top of the page.


![Editing the form](docs/assets/screenshot3.png)


This is the Edit Form page. You can click on a question to change its wording, and change the wording of the message that appears after people complete a form at the bottom on the right hand side.


However, **you can't add any extra emojis** - we haven't included scalable versions of more emojis than the ones we're using. If you want to use a different emoji or other symbol, email jeff@mozillafoundation.org.

##How to embed the form separately


![Embedding the form](docs/assets/screenshot5.png)


You might want to share the form separately before launching the infographic, in order to get the first responses into the system. You can embed it in a webpage either as an iframe or a script tag, or share it as a standalone page. You can access these options by clicking Edit Form at the top of the page, then on the Publish Options button on the left hand side.


You can also use this menu to close the form, if you don't want to allow any more submissions.


##How to change the rest of the text


The rest of the text in the interactive is changed via the Google Sheet you duplicated and created as part of the install.</p>


##How to create other forms/galleries


As part of this install, you now have a fully working version of The Coral Project's Ask tool. [You can read more about how to use it here.](https://docs.coralproject.net/products/ask/)
